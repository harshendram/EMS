# Employee Management System (EMS)

A minimalistic Employee Management System built with React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, using local storage as the backend. This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development, basic authentication, and task management. Admins can assign and track tasks, while employees can update task statuses.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Separate login for admin and employees.
- **Task Management:**
  - Admin: Assign tasks with details and monitor progress.
  - Employee: Accept/reject tasks and update progress.
- **Local Storage Backend:** Data is stored locally for persistence.

## Technologies Used

- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Local Storage**

## Credentials

- **Admin**  
  - **Username:** `admin@me.com`  
  - **Password:** `123`

- **Employee Example**
